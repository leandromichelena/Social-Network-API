# Social-Network-API
Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 18. This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Created using Express.js for routing, MongoDB NoSQL database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 18. <br>
This API was created to showcase a NoSQL database and its connections. The API routes were created using Express.js, while the database was built using MongoDB and is managed using the npm package Mongoose (object modeling tool). For creating data and format it, this app uses the time-stamp npm package.

## Usage
Please see a demonstration of the routes running in Insomnia App on this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWpTBOV0foCtm7wuGmEYNxuSKkQ1Svv-/view).
